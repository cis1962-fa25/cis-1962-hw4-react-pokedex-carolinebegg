# Homework 4 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.
>
> For this assignment I used Claude to help me think through parts of the React Pokedex, especially the API service class and styling for the Pokémon detail view. I’ve included a link to the full Claude conversation as well as the relevant transcript showing my prompts and the assistant’s responses. In addition to that chat-based help, I also used the built-in GitHub Copilot tool in VS Code, which autocompleted small chunks of code (for example, parts of React components and simple helper functions). Copilot’s suggestions were not always what I wanted and didn’t always correctly infer my intent, so I treated both tools as suggestions rather than something to blindly accept.

### Part 2

> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?
>
> I used AI mainly as a way to keep moving when I wasn’t exactly sure how to proceed, and to help debug when I ran into errors I didn’t immediately know how to fix. Instead of starting from a blank page, I could ask the AI to sketch out an example of an API service class, a sprite carousel, or a card layout and then adapt it to match the assignment requirements. I also leaned on Copilot in VS Code for quick autocompletions of boilerplate code, such as mapping over arrays or setting up React hooks. Traditional search alone often gave me very general answers or long documentation pages, whereas the AI could respond directly in the context of my specific code and questions.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?
>
> Overall, the AI’s responses were mixed but often helpful. For example, when I asked it to walk me through how to structure the API service class and how to wire up the Pokémon sprite carousel, its explanations and sample code were clear and gave me a good starting point. As a debugging tool, though, it was more hit-or-miss: sometimes it correctly identified potential issues, but other times it guessed wrong about the cause of an error or suggested changes that didn’t actually match my setup. The same was true for Copilot autocompletions: occasionally it produced exactly the code I needed, and other times it generated something unrelated to my intent. Because of this, I rarely accepted responses “as-is” — I usually adapted parts of the suggestions, verified them against the assignment spec and TypeScript types, and manually edited the code to make sure it actually worked.

### Part 4

> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
>
> The AI didn’t really introduce brand-new syntax or concepts so much as help reinforce things I’d already seen but wasn’t fully confident about yet. For example, it showed a clean pattern for organizing a dedicated API service class (like PokemonAPI with methods such as getPokemonList and getPokemonDetails that return typed `Promise<Pokemon>` values). I used that as a chance to review why separating API logic from React components is a good idea for structure and maintainability.
